    <h1>You are accessing CGM Measures over an unencrypted connection.</h1>
    <p>
      The CGM Measures web application should be configured to use HTTPS rather than HTTP.  Using HTTP to access CGM Measures could allow responses from the CGM Measures web application to be intercepted and viewed.  HTTPS connections should be used to load webpages containing sensitive data such as personal health information (PHI).  You should configure your CGM Measures server to be served via HTTPS.  If you are running CGM Measures on Apache and Phusion Passenger, you can use the following steps to configure HTTPS.  See <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/</a> 
  <br><br>
  If this is a test instance of CGM Measures with no PHI, you can override this warning by setting the value force_unsecure_communications to true in CGM Measures/config/CGM Measures.yml and restart CGM Measures.
