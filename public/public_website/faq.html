        <div class="questionAnswer firstQuestion">
  	      <div class="question" id="whatIsPopHealth">What is popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth is a prototype open source tool that automates population health reporting.  popHealth integrates with a healthcare provider's electronic health record (EHR) system to produce summary quality measures on the provider's patient population.  popHealth provides a streamlined mechanism for reporting summary quality information to federal agencies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="objective">What is the objective of popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth is designed to simplify the reporting of summary quality measures, and streamline the exchange of summary quality data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="users">Who are the intended users of popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been designed to provide proof of concept to healthcare providers, and EHR vendors.  Providers are empowered to better understand the health of their patient population through reports of quality measures. EHR vendors are free to download, use, and redistribute the popHealth software in their products.</p>
		<p>Key to popHealth's value for providers and vendors interested in implementing summary quality reporting:</p>
		  <ul>
            <li>The ability to quickly view and report static quality measures based on established quality measures</li>
            <li>Provides users with the ability to dynamically add new, ad hoc reports based upon individually composed queries</li>
            <li>Infrastructure to eventually remotely automate the addition of new quality measure reports, and export multiple modes of reporting output</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="philosophy">What is the popHealth design philosophy?</div>
          <p>popHealth is designed for ease of deployment, use and integration with a healthcare provider's EHR system. The software has been designed to be permissive and extensible, with the ability to support various data standards for input and output. All popHealth software, and dependent libraries are available under an open source distribution license.</p>
          <p>popHealth demonstrates an alternative approach to population health analysis and reporting. It does this by performing analysis within a healthcare provider's infrastructure and producing a summary data for evaluation and submission. This option provides an alternative to existing models where providers must transport large quantities of data, which simplifies the reporting and review process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="vendor">Do I need to be a healthcare provider or EHR vendor to use popHealth?</div>
  	      <p>No.  While a healthcare provider will have access to real patient records, and an EHR provider will have a much better understanding of the technical details of the data standards that are used for healthcare information technology systems, we have ensured that others can use popHealth.  Based on the scope of a user who downloads popHealth, you may be limited in the ability to use popHealth in a production setting.  However, even a novice technologist interested in learning more about healthcare information technology will benefit from downloading and setting up an instance of popHealth.  Additionally, there are several scripts that can populate popHealth with notionally random patient records, that have some statistical basis on the randomized values.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="report">How can popHealth be used to report EHR quality measurement data?</div>
          <p>At its core, popHealth is a simple way of aggregating patients' healthcare data inside a provider's secure operational system.  By providing software that can perform analysis and reporting from within a healthcare provider's infrastructure, popHealth demonstrates an alternative approach to population health analysis and reporting.  It is an alternative to the existing, legacy model of centralized data collection and analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="meaningfuluse">Can popHealth be used to demonstrate Meaningful Use?</div>
          <p>The reports produced by popHealth are for demonstration purposes and are not currently recognized for reporting sanctioned quality measures. However, the reports, processes and data standards used by popHealth provide examples of the proposed meaningful definitions for quality measures. We are currently attempting to identify how popHealth could be used operationally by US healthcare providers to demonstrate meaningful use on production systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="standards">What standards does popHealth use?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been designed to be permissive, and support numerous data and transport standards.  popHealth's first deployment uses the <a href="http://hitsp.org/ConstructSet_Details.aspx?&PrefixAlpha=4&PrefixNumeric=32">HITSP C32</a> standard for data input, and the Physician Quality Report Initiative (PQRI) registry XML for reporting output. popHealth is designed to be extensible, supporting multiple standards for both input and output into the future; <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/CDA-Release2-Unofficial.html" target="_external">CDA documents</a>, <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Product_CCD">HL7 CCD</a>, <a href="http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/E31_ConceptPaper.doc">ASTM CCR</a>, and the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Quality_Reporting_Document_Architecture">HL7 QRDA</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="provideruse">What is basic Concept of Operations for use of popHealth by a provider?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been designed to operate within a provider’s infrastructure.  This design decision has been made to address privacy and security concerns associated with access to information associated with individual patient records.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="browsers">What web browsers can be used with popHealth?</div>
  	      <p>popHealth has been developed and tested for use in FireFox 3.0 and higher, Internet Explorer (IE) 7, and IE 8, as well as Safari 4.  Support for other web browsers hasn't been tested, but the project will endeavour to support as many web browsers as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="newfields">Can a user add new measurements to the list of fields to choose from?</div>
  	      <p>Adding new measurements from the continuity of care record, beyond those listed on the dashboard and report views, is possible.  However, it requires some reconfiguring by a software engineer.  The estimated scope of adding a new measurement (ie. a new lab result type) to the user interface should take under 1 hour for an experienced software engineer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="languages">What programming languages does popHealth use?</div>
          <p>popHealth runs on <a href="http://jruby.org/" target="_external">JRuby</a>, an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Developing new software with popHealth, and/or adding new customized features will require non-trivial software development knowledge of the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_external">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_external">Java</a> programming languages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="connect">How is popHealth related to CONNECT open source?</div>
          <p>The popHealth software can be integrated with an EHR to extract patient health record data.  The popHealth software has been designed to be flexible, and support a variety of transport protocols for reporting and exchanging the population health report artifacts.  This includes integration with the CONNECT File Transfer Adapter plugin, which will be demonstrated at the HIMSS 2010 Interoperability Showcase.  Because of CONNECT's role integrating healthcare information technology data and transport standards, the popHealth software and project website are also available via the <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org/display/Gateway/CONNECT+Community+Portal" target="_external">CONNECT open source website.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
  	      <div class="question" id="laika">How is popHealth related to project Laika?</div>
          <p>The vast majority of the software supporting popHealth runs atop of <a href="http://www.mitre.org" target="_external">the MITRE Corporation's</a> open source <a href="http://projectlaika.org" target="_external">Laika</a> project infrastructure.  All of the supporting Laika software and source code, is also freely available under an Apache 2.0 open source distribution license.</p>
        </div>
