## Installing Dependencies

The Thorax component no longer includes dependencies due to possible versioning conflicts between libraries and consumers of Thorax. Thorax is tested with the following dev config:

    "devDependencies": {
      "jquery": "1.9.0",
      "underscore": "1.4.4",
      "zepto": "1.0.0",
      "handlebars": "1.0.0",
      "backbone": "1.0.0"
    }
