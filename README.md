popHealth
=========

popHealth is an open source tool that allows healthcare providers to calculate quality measures. A quality measure is a calculation of the number of individuals in a population that meet a specific standard of care.

popHealth can import patient summaries in either [QRDA Cat I](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=35) or [HITSP C32](http://www.hitsp.org/ConstructSet_Details.aspx?&PrefixAlpha=4&PrefixNumeric=32) format. popHealth will extract information from the patient summaries and calculate quality reports.

Project Practices
=================

Please try to follow our [Coding Style Guides](http://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide). Additionally, we will be using git in a pattern similar to [Vincent Driessen's workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). While feature branches are encouraged, they are not required to work on the project.
